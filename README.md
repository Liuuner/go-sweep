# go-sweep: Minesweeper in your terminal

I needed to learn go in preparation for advent of code this year, so I thought I would make one of my favorite games using go! I also wanted to learn how to make terminal UI apps, so I opted to use the [bubbletea tui framework](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea) to accomplish that.

## Demo

![go-sweep gif](./go-sweep.gif)

## To Run

1. `go build .`
2. `./go-sweep`

Please feel free to make an issue if you find any problems with the game! Sweep on!
